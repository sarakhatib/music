        <span style="font-size: large">What is amazing about music is that it is imbedded within
            all of us. Everyone can understand it and feel something if they open themselves
            up. Playing music with other musicians is an incredible feeling. Some people describe
            it as rowing down a river together.</span><br style="font-size: large" />
        <span style="font-size: large">There is a certain type of connection that comes when
            you make music in a group. The same is true for those who are listening to music
            in a group and interacting with music through Dance. This type of behavior is rooted
            in our history and our discoveries as human beings.</span><br />

    <span style="font-size: large">&nbsp Music can be very engaging in the classroom and
        is a great tool for memorization. I’m sure if more teachers used song to teach the
        multiplication tables, kids would retain that information much quicker.</span><br
            style="font-size: large" />
    <span style="font-size: large">Besides the obvious, Music teaches us self discipline
        and time management skills that you cannot get anywhere else. When you study an
        instrument on a regular basis you work on concrete ideas and take small steps to
        achieve larger goals. This way of thinking organizes the wiring in your brain to
        start looking at Learning in a new light.</span><br style="font-size: large" />
    <span style="font-size: large">In raising children, Music education can be used to keep
        kids focused and keep them off the streets. Instead of running around and causing
        mischief, your child may be practicing piano or rehearsing music with friends.</span><br
            style="font-size: large" />
    <span style="font-size: large">Unfortunately, some forms of music can influence children
        in negative ways. It is well known that music has a power to influence the way we
        dress, think, speak, and live our lives. Profane and violent lyrics can have a negative
        influence on children.</span><br />

        <span style="font-size: large">Music can whisk you away on an extended journey. Music
            can make time feel frozen. Music also has the power to suggest movement. All these
            things deal with the human senses.</span><br style="font-size: large" />
        <span style="font-size: large">I’m sure you can remember a moment where a song has made
            you particularly sad or very excited and happy. But how does organized tones create
            such an effect on our senses? No one really knows why or where it comes from but
            there are many studies that have been done to show that there is an agreement of
            which emotions pertain to certain scales, chords, and harmonies.</span><br />
