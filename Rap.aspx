Rapping is "spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics".
The components of rapping include "content", "flow" (rhythm and rhyme), and "delivery".
Rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.
Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon can be said to predate hip hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa and is composed of hip hop elements.
